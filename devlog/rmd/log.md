# Development Log - Rob Drimmie

## Log
20221113 1033 I am being prideful. I am setting this up as though someday this will be of interest to some community that exists. No such community exists, which is far more glum than the first hopeful entry into a development log should be.

1035 This is a style of logging that I follow when working on a personal project, and this is quite probably the most elaborate personal project I've worked on to date. 

So this is a game I'm working on where the player manages the equipment of several characters who are exploring a realm and doing basic adventurer-type tasks like killing things and taking all the stuff from the things. I have a variety of thoughts about that which are relevant to this game but that will be for some other time. 

1037 Right now my goal is to make a stable fresh start. I have some extremely unlikely aspirations that amount to a community building up around this game which allows me to make more games while supporting myself and my family. I don't expect any of that to happen, maybe someone will buy me a beer some day, but that's the conceit under which I write this log and the audience to whom I write it.

1039 The project started quite some time ago and has gone through several different rough forms to get to where it is today, which is a moderately stable (by no means bug free, just consistent in its behaviours intentional and otherwise) system. 

1040 This repository is a fresh start for it. I'm going to be migrating the logic over, hopefully in large chunks, but also taking opportunities here and there to tidy up and refactor and lose the cruft of a poorly planned iteratively designed project.
