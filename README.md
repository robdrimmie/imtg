Inventory Management: The Game

## About

(Inventory Management: The Game)[http://imtg.robsdreamco.com] is a procedurally generated rpg-like game, where parties roam a hexagonal map, acquire items through combat and exploration and use or sell those items improving their abilities and allowing them explore further. Unlike most such games, the player does not control the characters, the player controls their inventories.

This is the game's source code. The game itself can be played at the link above.

## Roadmap
20221113 1027 So, there is not much here right now. I am working on migrating the source in from a much older repository that has a lot of experiments and missteps and private thoughts and sloppy code and other things that I don't want to share with the world. 

Playing the game isn't really fun yet, and there's a reasonable chance it might never be. But I get a lot of satisfaction from messing around with all of it and it is approaching a point where I think I will feel like my thoughts about it are concrete enough to establish and communicate what I think it might be able to become, which means that I am almost comfortable sharing it with people. 

There are many systems implemented and interactions between them, but they are all very naive implementations. Combat strategies only as complex as pick and attack the first enemy, exploration goals like "a place where there is content". 

I have hopes for this. Very high among them the hope that other people find it, and eventually find it interesting as well.

## Contributing
I'm not quite ready for contributions at this time, especially since this README is going to be the very first commit with no code or anything.
